# DevOps Lifecycle Overview 

## 1. Foundational DevOps Concepts

**What is DevOps?**
DevOps is a cultural and organizational philosophy that unites software development and IT operations teams. Its goal is to speed up delivery of high-quality applications by promoting collaboration, automation, and shared responsibility.

**Core Principles:**

* **Collaboration & Communication:** Break down silos so dev, ops, QA, and other teams work cross-functionally .
* **Automation:** Automate everything from builds and tests to deployments to reduce errors and speed up cycles 
* **Continuous Improvement & Feedback:** Use metrics, monitoring, and faster feedback loops to iteratively improve software delivery 
* **End-to-End Responsibility:** Teams own releases from concept through operations and decommissioning

## 2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages

1. **Planning**
   Define project scope, user stories, backlog items, and infrastructure requirements.

2. **Development**
   Write, review, and version-control code; build features collaboratively.

3. **Building**
   Compile code and put together artifacts using automated build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle).

4. **Testing**
   Run automated unit, integration, and acceptance tests to validate quality.

5. **Release**
   Prepare and stage builds for deployment—often via CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Deployment**
   Deploy the release to production or staging environments, frequently with automation.

7. **Operations**
   Manage infrastructure, configurations, scaling, and incident response in production.

8. **Monitoring**
   Collect logs, metrics, and user feedback to track system health and inform improvements.
